# gh-noti

Github CLI extension to check unread notifications in this [page](https://github.com/notifications).

As the feature is available in `gh`, see [this issue](https://github.com/cli/cli/issues/659).

Still WIP.

## Installation

```sh
gh extension install bambooom/gh-noti
```

Needs `jq` installed

```sh
brew install jq
```

## Usage

1. `gh noti` : list all unread notifications

```

```

Or no unread:

```
âœ¨ No unread notifications.
```

2. `gh noti read`: mark all notifications as read

3. `gh noti read <id>`: use the id in the list to mark one thread as read

## Todo
- [x] mark all as read, https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/activity#mark-notifications-as-read
- [x] mark one as read by id, https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/activity#mark-a-thread-as-read
- [ ] open a unread notification thread url
